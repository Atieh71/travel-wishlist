          One of my dream destinations is **Masal**, a beautiful small city in Iran. Known for its breathtaking green 
          landscapes, dense forests, and misty hills, Masal is a paradise for nature lovers. Itâ€™s a peaceful retreat 
          away from the hustle and bustle, offering tranquility and unmatched natural beauty.
